<h1>Coding Definitions</h1>
<p>Phishing: The practice of sending emails acting as a big company to get personal info from others.
Flaming: Insulting and harassing a said person over the internet.
Spamming: Junk mail sent to a user who doesn’t want it.
	The way these definitions are similar is that they all have negative connotation and are all internet activities. Similarly they all use email as well. The difference in these topics would probably be the result you’d get out of it. Phishing is mainly for attracting personal info from others while flaming is just for malicious intent.
